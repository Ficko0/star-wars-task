# Star Wars Task

### This is my solution to the task I was given!

## To run the project, follow these steps bellow :)

1. Navigate to the root directory
2. Once inside, in the terminal run **npm i**
3. After installing the packages, run **npm run dev**

##Note!
At the time of publishing this and sending this task, the API didn't work.
Some of the components might be out of place since I couldn't see the components.

The problem with the API when using the Apollo Studio was as follows:

{
  "name": "NetworkError",
  "message": "Failed to fetch"
}

The API seems to have an issue which hasn't been resolved the entire Sunday.
